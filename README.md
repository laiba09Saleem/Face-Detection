A modern, browser-based **face detection and analysis** web application built with [face-api.js](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js). It supports detecting faces in **uploaded images** as well as **real-time video** (webcam feed), with advanced options for facial landmarks, expressions, age, and gender estimation.

Features

- Detect faces from:
  - Uploaded images (PNG, JPG, JPEG)
  - Live webcam video feed  
- Detect and visualize:
  - Face bounding boxes
  - 68-point facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth, jawline)
  - Facial expressions (happy, sad, surprised, angry, etc.)
  - Age and gender estimation  
- Adjustable minimum confidence threshold for flexible detection sensitivity.  
- User-selectable detection options to enable/disable features on the fly.  
- Results summary table showing detection confidence, dominant expressions, age, and gender.  
- Lightweight client-side processing using TensorFlow.js and face-api.js ‚Äî no backend or server processing required.  
- Intuitive and responsive UI supporting both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technologies

- **face-api.js** ‚Äî face recognition and detection powered by TensorFlow.js  
- **HTML5 / CSS3 / JavaScript** ‚Äî frontend UI and logic  
- **MediaDevices API** ‚Äî access to webcam for real-time video detection  
- Runs entirely client-side ‚Äî no server dependencies besides hosting static files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari recommended)  
- Local or remote HTTP(S) server to serve files (models won‚Äôt load via `file://` protocol)

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-webapp.git
cd face-detection-webapp
````

2. **Download face-api.js models**

Create a `/models` directory inside the project root. Download the required pre-trained models from the [face-api.js models repository](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights) and place them inside `/models`.

Required models include (but are not limited to):

* `tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json` + binary files
* `face_landmark_68_tiny_model-weights_manifest.json` + binaries
* `face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json` + binaries
* `age_gender_model-weights_manifest.json` + binaries

Alternatively, download the entire weights folder and place it into `/models`.


## Usage

1. Select the input type at the top:

   * **Image** ‚Äî upload an image file (PNG, JPG, JPEG) for detection
   * **Video** ‚Äî use your webcam for real-time face detection

2. Adjust detection options:

   * Check/uncheck options to enable detection of landmarks, expressions, and age/gender
   * Adjust the minimum confidence slider to increase/decrease detection sensitivity

3. When using video, click **Start Video** to begin webcam feed and detection, **Stop Video** to end.

4. The app will display face bounding boxes and overlays on the image or video, plus a detailed table with detection info.

Configuration

 **Models Folder Path:**
  Ensure the `/models` folder is located at the root relative to `index.html`. If you change the folder name or location, update the `loadModels()` function accordingly.

**Detection Options:**
  Enable/disable detection features in the UI under detection options dropdown.

**Detection Confidence:**
  Adjust the minimum confidence slider to tune detection sensitivity (default 0.5).


Troubleshooting

**Models not loading:**

  * Verify the `/models` folder exists with all required files.
  * Confirm you are running via an HTTP server (not directly opening `index.html` with `file://` protocol).
  * Check browser console for error messages.

**Camera access issues:**

  * Ensure camera permissions are granted in your browser.
  * Test webcam functionality in other applications to rule out hardware issues.

**No detections:**

  * Increase confidence threshold if too high.
  * Verify that the image/video contains visible faces.
  * Check that detection options are properly enabled.

**Performance lag:**

  * Use a device with adequate CPU/GPU.
  * Lower input resolution or disable non-essential detection options.
